                    the defenses you can present.</a> The following are, in simpler terms, instances in which you are
                not responsible for paying the ticket:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>You did not own the car when you received the ticket</li>
                    <li>The vehicle was stolen, or license plates were stolen when you received the ticket</li>
                    <li><b>There were no signs, or they weren’t clear enough, to stop you from parking*</b></li>
                    <li>If there was a parking meter and it didn’t work</li>
                    <li>The parking ticket incorrectly states a violation, or there is no evidence of it</li>
                    <li>You were ticketed for something that wasn’t against the rules at the time you received the
                        ticket</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Gather Evidence. Save any photos and videos you may have, have an accurate description of the scene, and
                save your 10 digit ticket number. The City of Chicago website allows you to <a

            <li>You’ve submitted a request for a hearing and you’ve gathered your evidence. Now you have to present your
                case. The goal is to address the following:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Start with a formal salutation to the judge, such as “Good morning, Your Honor.”</li>

        <h1>Example Appeal</h1>
        <h2>Here is what you may do if you got a ticket for parking during street cleaning</h2>
        <p class="tab">Good Morning, Your Honor. My name is John Smith. I am here to contest ticket number 0000112233,
            which I received on December 3rd on Lincoln Ave. I found a spot on the street as the parking lot was full,
            and I made sure to follow the signs. I was ticketed for parking during “Street Cleaning”, but the spot I
            parked in had no legible signs . I shouldn’t be ticketed because according to Municipal Code, I should not
            get a ticket if a sign is not legible. In this picture here, you can see, Your Honor, that the one sign that
            was there was torn and the timings were not visible. I ask that my ticket be dismissed. Thank you, Your
            Honor.</p>
