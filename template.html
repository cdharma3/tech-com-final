        <h2>Example Appeal 1</h2>
        <h3>Here is what you may do if you got a ticket for parking during street cleaning</h3>
        <p class="tab">
            Good Morning Your Honor <br>
            My name is John Smith and I am here to contest a parking ticket I received on December 3rd at around 3:30pm on Lincoln Ave. 
            I parked on the right side of the street as the parking lot was full, and I made sure to follow the surrounding signs. 
            I was ticketed for parking during a street cleaning time, but the spot I parked wasn't covered by any signs.
            In this picture here, you can see, Your Honor, that the one sign that was there was torn and the timings were not visible. 
            I ask that my ticket be dismissed. 
            Thank you, Your Honor.
        </p>
