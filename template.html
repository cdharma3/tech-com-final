                    the defenses you can present.</a> The following are, in simpler terms, instances in which you are

            </li>
            <li>Gather Evidence. Save any photos and videos you may have, have an accurate description of the scene, and
                save your 10 digit ticket number. The City of Chicago website allows you to <a

        <h2>Example Appeal</h2>
        <h3>Here is what you may do if you got a ticket for parking during street cleaning</h3>
        <p class="tab">Good Morning, Your Honor. My name is John Smith. I am here to contest ticket number 0000112233,
            which I received on December 3rd on Lincoln Ave. I found a spot on the street as the parking lot was full,
            and I made sure to follow the signs. I was ticketed for parking during “Street Cleaning”, but the spot I
            parked in had no legible signs . I shouldn’t be ticketed because according to Municipal Code, I should not
            get a ticket if a sign is not legible. In this picture here, you can see, Your Honor, that the one sign that
            was there was torn and the timings were not visible. I ask that my ticket be dismissed. Thank you, Your
            Honor.</p>
